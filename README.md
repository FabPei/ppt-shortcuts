# Instrumenta Keys
Instrumenta Keys is a **keyboard shortcut companion** for [Instrumenta](https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/), bringing **customizable keyboard shortcuts** to Instrumenta. Since **VBA for PowerPoint lacks native keyboard shortcut support**, Instrumenta Keys -written in **Microsoft PowerShell**- runs independently alongside Instrumenta, enabling users to **assign shortcuts via a simple CSV file**.

## Features
- **Fully configurable:** Easily customize shortcuts in the CSV file to match your workflow.
- **Runs independently:** Instrumenta Keys works alongside Instrumenta without modifying its core functionality.
- **Compatible with other VBA projects:** Designed to integrate with any VBA-based automation, not just Instrumenta.
